# Best-Hydrogen-Water-Bottle-In-The-Market
A hydrogen water bottle is a device designed to infuse regular water with molecular hydrogen gas (H₂), creating hydrogen-rich water that some studies suggest may have health benefits. Here's an overview of key aspects:

How it Works
Hydrogen water bottles use electrolysis, typically through advanced technologies like Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE), to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen gas is infused into the water while oxygen and other byproducts (e.g., chlorine) are expelled​
